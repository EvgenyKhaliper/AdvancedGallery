## Advanced Gallery
You need to create 2 ReactJS applications which communicate using any technology or method (up to your imagination). If you lack of ideas, you can use https://requestbin.com/ *try new version* (simple signup is required) to send POST & GET events.  

### Application 'Search'
A search input which on enter informs the application 'Gallery' of the desired query.

### Application 'Gallery'
Upon application 'Search' request this application should query 9 images from https://pixabay.com (require simple signup or any other service you know of). 
Present the images in 3 columns per row as 100x100 px thumbnails. Underneath each image there should be tags (can be found in https://pixabay.com api). Once the image is clicked on, a new view should open with a full size image and the tags below the image.

### Notes
1. Create branch in github repository with your full name. ie. john-snow
2. You can use any package to achieve the goal.
3. You should use modern design techniques both for JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
4. Try to place both applications on the same HTML page to simplify user experience.
